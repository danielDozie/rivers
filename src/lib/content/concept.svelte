<p>This was the opening line of the Major General Yakubu Gowon speech to the nation in May 1967 when twelve States were
    created out of the (then) four Regions that had existed since the 1950s, you’d be encouraged to read the full statement. At
    the time there was a political crisis that was threatening to push the nation into a civil war, an agitation largely emanating
    from the Eastern Region. At the same time, there was a major clamour around the unfortunate, extensive, and continued
    marginalisation experienced by some minorities, a clamour that had somewhat come to a very critical point – particularly in again the Eastern Region of the Country.</p>

        To pre-emptively weaken the growing secessionist movement and strategically attend to the clamour of marginalisation, the then Gowon-led Supreme Military Council with Decree No 8 of 1967, created twelve States out of the four Regions. Rivers State was one of the twelve, with Naval Lieutenant Commander Alfred Papapreye Diete-Spiff appointed as Military
Administrator; he was aged 25 years at the time. Unfortunately, civil war still broke out shortly after and lasted about three years. Also known as the Biafran War it was fought between the government of Nigeria and the secessionist Republic of Biafra, which surrendered in early 1970 to Nigerian forces making famous the Nigerian motto “No-victor, No-vanquished”.

        With the creation of the State, it is necessary to mention persons that comprised the Diete-Spiff led team which steered the affairs of the Rivers State ship from the time of its birth for almost a decade on. The State in general, Port Harcourt in
particular, have to date pretty much lived off the back of the ground work credited to this team of incredible and long-sighted men.
